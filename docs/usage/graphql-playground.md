Whenever the api server is running, the client-side GraphQL playground is available.
The playground makes it easy to get to know the API and try new operations.

The playground is available at each prisma service endpoint.
If no project & stage is defined in `api/prisma.yml` the endpoint is by default <http:/localhost:4000>.
